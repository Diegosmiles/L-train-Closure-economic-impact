# L-train-Closure-economic-impact

This repo includes all relevant files for the USI social impact project

Four notebooks comprise the total methodology:
usi_turnstile.ipynb - reads in turnstile data and wrangles it down to number of exits per turnstile per station per day 

usi_loss.ipynb - estimates size of the Williamsburg economy and size of the economy within a quarter mile radius of the Bedford Ave. station

usi_foot_traffic.ipynb - first pass estimate on measuring the impact of reducing the amount of foot traffic in the area

usi_final_calculations - combines ui_loss and usi_foot_traffic to determine estimated financial impact on the local economy



The goal of this project is to establish a methodology for calculating the economic impact on a neighborhood resulting from closing down subway stations. In this case, the analysis will focus on a segment of the L train closure and its impact on businesses in the Williamsburg area
